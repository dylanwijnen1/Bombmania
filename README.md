# Bombmania

## The Game

The idea came from wanting to be able to create a game that is realtime yet not to complex in its game mechanics.

I thought of games from the Nintendo DS and remembered Bomberman. I loved playing this game with friends.

Bomberman is a game where multiple players on a tiled map place bombs on the map. These bombs can destroy certain tiles and hit the player. Tiles can drop powerups that increase the size of the bomb or allows the player to control the bomb detonation. And many more interactions.

## The Plan

I will likely stick to the basics of bomberman without adding too many complex interactions and power ups unless I have a lot of time left.

My plan is to first integrate all the tools and libraries that I want which I have partially done already such as ImGui and RmlUi. There may be the addition of [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) which is an ECS framework.

I would like to work on the basis framework up to the midterm and reuse this framework for the final project. They will be written in the same project which may be a little messy. If it doesn't hold up I may want to use [yojimbo](https://github.com/networkprotocol/yojimbo) but I'm hoping I don't have to.

I have also created all my wishes for the project onto [codecks](https://dylan-wijnen.codecks.io/decks) which may be a bit unrealistic but I'm hoping to get enough done to be able to continue with this project as a nice portfolio piece.
